# Xrome
A very basic operating system written in **C** and **Assembly**. 

- Note: boot sector is not made by me.

## Building

You'll need cross-platform compilers like ``x86_64-elf-gbb``, ``x86_64-elf-gcc`` and ``x86_64-elf-ld`` for compiling and linking binaries. You can change the paths of them in "Makefile".

Simply execute
```s
$ make
```
and that's it.
